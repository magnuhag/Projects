Hobby projects

1) Fraud detection:
  - Using different kinds of machine learning methods to attempt to make a reliable fraud detection classifier. Dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/code/dcw8161/fraud-detection-bank-dataset/data

2) Neural Network:
  - Neural Network written from scratch in Python. I have also included a Jupyter Notebook for describing the math we're doing. Also applied test case using the MNIST dataset
  
3) numerical_integration:
  - Python class for doing improper integrals. Sketchy at best.
