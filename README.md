Hobby projects

1) Neural Network:
  - Neural Network written from scratch in Python. I have also included a Jupyter Notebook for describing the necessary math. Included in this notebook is an applied test case using the MNIST dataset. I'm also in the (beginning of the) process of writing my own implementation of automatic differetiation using Wengert lists, so that back prop might be a bit quicker than current implementation - which is fantastically slow. 
  
2) numerical_integration:
  - Python class for doing improper integrals of the type
  
  $$
  I_1 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{f(x) \\, dx}
  $$
  
  $$
  I_2 = \int_{a}^{\infty}{f(x)  \\, dx}
  $$
  
  $$
  I_3 = \int_{-\infty}^{a}{f(x) \\, dx}
  $$
